# Advanced-smart-lock

In this paper, the design and implementation of a Arduino based Smart lock have 
been presented and analysed. An Arduino Uno, r307 fingerprint module, a12V 
Solenoid Lock, Node MCU, Other basic requirement such as relays, 
resistors(2.2k), jump wires etc., and an internet connection are responsible for the 
reliable operation of the proposed Smart Lock. The end user will be able to 
interact with a web-based application that provides them with information and 
different ways to unlock the door and enable/disable the smart lock.
